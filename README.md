# -> READ ME FIRST <-
**This the first program I ever created for a """productive""" purpose. Also, at that time, I was studying in the second semester of the degree. I hope you understand**.

# Completed-Games Register v.1 in C
A simple program (in Spanish) that contains a completed-games register (I meant, "beaten-games" register).

## A brief explanation of its usage
You can add, remove and edit a game. Also, you can visualize each one with its respective stats (not all).

## The "Game" element fields
Each game inside the program contains the following fields:

* Name
* Image URL
* Review/Opinion/Comments
* Spoiler
* Notes
* Completion year
* Platforms

## Why would I generate an HTML-Page of this?
My main objective with this program was to ease the task of adding games into a list. I update that one into [my website](https://mralexbross-web.blogspot.com/p/inicio.html) named "[Juegos completados (Beaten Games)](https://mralexbross-web.blogspot.com/p/played-games.html)".
